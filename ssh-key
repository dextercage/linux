If you only have .ppk file then it would be useful to create a .pem file and then connect to your server using that.
In you Ubuntu computer, install putty-tools with the following command:
sudo apt-get install putty-tools
Now convert your .ppk file to .pem using the following command:
puttygen yourkey.ppk -O private-openssh -o yourkey.pem
Set the proper permission to use the .pem file with following command:
chmod 400 yourkey.pem
Now connect to your server using the below command:
ssh -i yourkey.pem serverusername@server-ip
